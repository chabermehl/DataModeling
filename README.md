# DataModeling
These are assignments from a data modelling class. In this class we sought to model logic gates with DNA. By analyzing complicated DNA strings we are able to build graphs, and based on their outputs we were able to determine the structure of the logic gate formed by the DNA strings based on their threshold value.
